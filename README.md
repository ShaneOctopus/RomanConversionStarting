# RomanConversionStarting - A project to show BDD/TDD in 60 minutes (more time needed for good discussion)
This is a guided demo showing the flow of development from BDD to TDD starting from an “empty” app. In the working directory is a PowerPoint file that has about 10 minutes of introduction before going into a 50 minute guided demo. In the Word document, the needed code to perform the demo is organized by slide.
The demo covers:
•	Setup
•	Starting the story work with acceptance criteria in a .feature file
•	Creating and writing step definition code to link the English specs to the application
•	Writing a failing unit test
•	Writing some application code to get a unit and functional test to pass
•	Refactoring code to improve the design
•	Refactoring the specification to fix “errors” in the specification
•	Living documentation
The code is in Java and follows a Roman Numeral conversion Kata.
The process I go through is:
•	10 minute introduction
•	50 minute demo
•	30 minute discussion
