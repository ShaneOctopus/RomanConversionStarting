# RomanConversionStarting - A project to show BDD/TDD in 60 minutes (more time needed for good discussion)
<p>This is a guided demo showing the flow of development from BDD to TDD starting from an “empty” app. In the working directory is a PowerPoint file that has about 10 minutes of introduction before going into a 50 minute guided demo. In the Word document, the needed code to perform the demo is organized by slide.</p>
<p>The demo covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup</li>
<li>Starting the story work with acceptance criteria in a .feature file</li>
<li>Creating and writing step definition code to link the English specs to the application</li>
<li>Writing a failing unit test</li>
<li>Writing some application code to get a unit and functional test to pass</li>
<li>Refactoring code to improve the design</li>
<li>Refactoring the specification to fix “errors” in the specification</li>
<li>Living documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>The code is in Java and follows a Roman Numeral conversion Kata.
The process I go through is:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 minute introduction
<li>50 minute demo
<li>30 minute discussion</li>
</ul>
